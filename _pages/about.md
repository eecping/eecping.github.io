# Who I Am #

I am a researcher and communicator excited about science for the public good.

My academic background is in neuroscience, the history of science, and community engagement, and I have work experience in research, libraries, and writing, among others.

Presently, I am the Lab Manager of the Social Cognitive Neuroscience Lab at The Ohio State University and a graduate student-at-large exploring topics in bioethics, policy, information science, and neuroscience.
