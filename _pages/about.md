## About this site
This site functions as the bibliography for [my blog](https://www.elliotping.com). It is mostly a listing of the things that I read and engage with, sometimes with notes and sometimes without. For my ease of use, posts are organized by date of publication and categorized by type of media (article, book, podcast, etc.). I use a loose APA citation style. 

## Who I am 

I am a researcher and communicator excited about science for the public good.

My academic background is in neuroscience, the history of science, and community engagement, and I've worked in research, libraries, and writing, among other fields.
