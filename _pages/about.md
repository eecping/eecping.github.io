I am the Lab Manager of the Social Cognitive Neuroscience Lab at The Ohio State University where we study how the brain processes naturalistic stimuli-- like movies, or images of real objects, or listening to a story-- and uses it to inform their knowledge of themselves, their knowledge of others, and their decisions. Right now, I am broadly interested in the neuroscience of communication, especially online sharing and political communication, and how this research can be used to inform better law and policy. You'll be able to find more about that on my Research page (coming soon). You can find out more about my professional and academic history on my LinkedIn here
