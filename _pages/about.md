## About this site
This is not a traditional blog; instead, it's an exercise in public learning and scholarship, closer to a mind garden or reading journal than to a collection of formal essays and polished thoughts. Any notes that you don't understand are likely not meant for you-- they're meant for me-- but I'm open to dialogue! If you want to chat about anything here, feel free to reach out to me at elliotping at gmail dot com. 

## Who I am 

I am a researcher and communicator excited about science for the public good.

My academic background is in neuroscience, the history of science, and community engagement, and I've worked in research, libraries, and writing, among other fields.

Presently, I am the Lab Manager of the Social Cognitive Neuroscience Lab at The Ohio State University and a graduate student-at-large exploring topics in bioethics, policy, information science, and neuroscience.
