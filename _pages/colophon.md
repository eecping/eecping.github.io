## This Website
My website is hosted on Github Pages with Jekyll. I am using the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mademistakes.com/work/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/) theme.

Posts and pages are written in Markdown. I am still experimenting with style and will let you know if that changes. 

You can see what my website looks like under the hood by looking [here](https://github.com/eecping/eecping.github.io).

## Book Curse
The content of this site is mine and mine alone, unless otherwise noted. As such, it is representative only of my own personal views. 
These are not necessarily the views of the institutions for which I have worked or volunteered or at which I have studied. 

Claiming any content herein as your own will make me sad and will probably bring some kind of karmic anathema on you, so I don't recommend it. Be aware that I reserve the right to change or remove content from this site at will: it is a living document representing my thoughts
in the current moment.
