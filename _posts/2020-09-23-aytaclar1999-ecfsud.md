Executive cognitive function capacity includes the ability to make plans, control oneâ€™s attention, reason abstractly, learn from experience, and generate ideas (Aytaclar, et al, 1999). Deficits in executive cognitive functioning have been observed in children whose parents abuse substances, in children with ADHD, and in children with conduct disorder (Aytaclar, et al, 1999).. Childhood executive cognitive function deficits is a salient predictor of substance use in earlier adolescence (Aytaclar, et al, 1999).

This study looks at alcohol and drug use, as well as nicotine and smoking. It divides participants into high risk and low-to-average risk groups by using paternal diagnosis of substance use disorder according to DSM-III-R.
