Girls with ADHD are more likely than controls to have conduct, mood, and anxiety disorders; lower achievement scores; more impairments in school, social, and family functioning; and substance use disorders. 
This paper demosntrates phenotypic similarities between genders in ADHD, but stresses that girls are often underdiagnosed and undertreated because of lower incidence of conduct disorder and hyperactivity in girls than in boys; however, girls tend toward greater intellectual impairments an dhigher rates of mood and anxiety disorders.
