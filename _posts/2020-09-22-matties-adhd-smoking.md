Authors were able to replicate the findings from previous work, finding a higher rate of smokers in the ADHD group (41.7%, vs. 21.7% in the gender-matched control, more severe nicotine dependence as reflected by FTND score, and ADHD patients smoked more often than controls and had earlier onset of smoking. Females with ADHD smoked more often and started smoking at an earlier age. Higher rates of ADHD symptoms from the hyperactivity/restlessness and impulsive domains associated with earlier smoking initiaiton and higher inclination to smoke.

60 adult participants, exlcuding participants with Axis 1 disorders (major depression, anxiety disorders, psychotic states). Included participants in ADHD group only if they met the diagnosis requirements for ADHD via DSM-IV. Participants self-reported symptoms from childhood and adulthood on a 4-point LIkert-type scale and using the Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scales. Smoking habits were assessed with the FTND.
