## Introduction

> ...the "public sphere," which I define, following Charles Taylor, as "a common space in which the members of society are deemed to meet through a variety of media... to discuss matters of common interest; and thus to be able to form a common mind about these" (Taylor 1995: 185-186). (*p. xii*)

Does this public sphere actually exist? More specifically, can there actually be such a thing as a cohesive public sphere? Idea: multiple overlapping Venn public spheres. 

> ...political scientist Albert Dzur summarized the roll of professions in the public sphere when he writes that "because of their specialized knowledge and claims to exclusive control over specific social problems, professions wield considerable power... the power to distract, encourage, limit, and inform public recognition of and deliberation over social problems." (*p. xiii*)

Perhaps one of the reasons why some professions "gatekeep" entry (via inaccessible forms of training, unliveable conditions for entry-level workers, etc.) is to maintain this power. If power is accessible to all, then there's nothing left to dominate.

> "[bioethics should]...set out the issues as objectively as possible, provide sound arguments for competing positions, and present them publicly in a restrained and balanced way... Th ebioethicist's purpose should be ot proivde the basis for th ekind of moral considerations upon which good policy rests" (Pellegrino 2006:578). (*p. xiv*)

>> ...bioethics seems destined for a short lifespan. Conspiring against it is exposure of the funding of some of its US centres by pharmaceutical companies; exclusion of alternative perspectives from the social sciences; retention of narrow analytical notions of ethics in the face of popular expression and academic respect for the place of emotions; divisions within the discipline (including over its origins and meaning); and collusions with, and appropriation by, clinical medicine. (Cooter 2004)
> (*p. xv-xvi*)

This seems to be a reasonable.These issues all question whether or not bioethics actually has the professional jurisdiction that it claims, and argues that it does not. If funding comes from parmaceutical companies and representation of popular expression and academic respect are both absent, then the trust required for the public to award bioethics jurisdiction is far from established. And the inability to include alternative social science perspectives or to stop appropriation of the field by medicine would suggest that there is significant competiiton to bioethics for this societal role. If competition is strong, then who or what has jurisdiction over an issue becomes less clear. 

> ...bioethical debate as the locus of competition between a number of professions vying for what I will call "jurisdiction" over the task of making ethical claims about medical and scientific technologies and practices." (*p. xvii*)

> A profession has jurisdiction if the audience for the jurisidctional evaluation thinks it should. (*p. xviii*)

> ...a profession obtains jurisdiction by having a "system of abstract knowledge" that legitimates its claim over certain tasks. (*p. xviii*)

> Professions do not simply take over and "professionalize* a task, but rather are in constant competition with each other for jurisdiction over the same tasks. (*p. xviii*)

> ...in the sociological approach to professions, professions are not defined by their associations or academic degrees, but by their systems of abstract knowledge. (*p. xxi*)

> "Liberal bioethics thus models itself on a rationalist and decisionist view of expertise, according to which experts provide value-neutral knowledge that allows non-experts to effectively pursue their subjective preferences" writers Brown (Brown 2009:45)."

Unconvinced of the existence of "value-neutral knowledge." Values are embedded in knowledge at the time of its creation.
