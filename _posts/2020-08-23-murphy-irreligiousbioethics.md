## Abstract

> Irreligious skeptcisim makes it possible to raise questions that otherwise go unasked and to protect against the overreach of religion. 

## Introduction

> ...moral theory intentionally employs only goals, methods, and evidence that prescind from theology. (*p. 3*)

>...bioethics can enter into dialogue with practitioners of any faith and can study the way in which religion shapes the bioethics views of any given group. (*p. 3*)

## Bioethics Fails Religion, Allegedly

> These commentators deploy a broad notion of religion, defining it primarily as a focus on "basic and transcendant aspects of the human condition, and enduring problems of meaning, to questions about human origins, identity; the 'whys' of pain and suffering, injustice and evil; the mysteries of life and death; and the wonders and enigmas of hope and endurance, compassion and caring, forgiveness and love." They define religion secondarily as a matter of doctrine, practice, and membership in a faith comunity (Messikomer et al. 2001, 486-487). (*p. 4*)

This primary definition of religion sounds absolutely whimsical. These broad, over-arching definition of religion seems to apply more to the *study* of religion, or to the lenses through once one can view religion, rather than actually to religion. The primary definition ought to be that of organized doctrine and practice, likely related to some creator-force. Otherwise it sounds like someone trying to sell someone on their college humanities program. 

> A culture's view of bioethical matters can be thick with religiosity; but understanding the religious origin or dimensions of that view is not the same thing as a normative evaluation of those matters. (*p. 4*)

> ...bioethics should be free to cnanibalize ideas pretty much wherever it can... the value of any borrowed theological content for bioethics will reside not in its being religious but on its being demonstrably valuable on separate moral and logical grounds. (*p. 4*)

> ...Fox, Messikomer, and Swazey never argue that bioethics should turn to religions because their underlying claims are true. (*p. 4*)

> ...the advantage that an irreligious bioethics offers: a detached vantage point from which to judge the value of religion... (*p. 5*)

Detached from *what*? 

> ...all religions seem convinced of their ability to address any and all issues in bioethics. (*p. 5*)

>...it enables questions that would otherwise go unasked, to the extent it thwarts facile answers, and to the extent that it discloses the total costs of one religion compared to another and th ecosts of religion compared to nonreligion. (*p. 5*)

> Irreligion is, perhaps surprisingly, available to virtually everyone as an analytical tool... (*p. 5*)
Is it really irreligion to deny the truth of another religion that is not your own? 

> ...bioethics is in the same situation as any human being. Either bioethics does its work on the assumption of an independently discerible morality or it must attempt to discern relevant divine fiats, which are--as far as human beings can tell--entirely idiosyncratic. (*p. 6*)

> No amount of presumbaly inerrant and divine truth has stood in the way of profound moral disagreement within and between religions... (*p. 6*)

> ...these distorting human factors are always going to remain in place... (*p. 6*)

## The Value of Irreligion
> Walsby offered a useful definition of ideology as "the complex system of cognitive assumptions and affective identifications, which manifest themselves in, or underlie, the thought, speech, aims, interest, ideals, ethical standards, actions-- in short the behaviors-- of an individual human being" (quoted in McGee 2011, 78). (*p. 6*)

> ...it is an illusion to believe tha tpolicy discussions can be "free of value presuppositions," many of which may not themselves meet the standards of being publicly accessible, shared, or persuaved... he says, "Religious values or reasons should not necessarily be held to a higher standard of public relevance than other forms of reason" (ibid., 503). (*p. 7*)

> [religious and paratheological values and suppositions] are accessible only by logically prior commitments to certain theological claims. (*p. 7*)

## Praying for the Injured and Sick
> ...intercessory prayer proceeds on a no-fault theory of injury, ill health, and disease, but it's not clear from a moral point of view how responding to prayers that way is justified. (*p. 8*)

> The notion of praying for health benefits for others is so conceptually confused and epistemologically uncertain that bioethics hsould treat it, normatively speaking, as a culturally interesting but morally incoherent folk practice. (*p. 8*)

> Any deference bioethics gives religion in this regard will have to turn on respect for cultural custom, not on the moral value of the practice. (*p. 8*)

## The Irreligious Work Ahead
> ...I don't see any a priori reason to think that these separate lines of thougth must necessarily conflict. Yet for bioethics the limiting factor is that religions ultimately rely on assumptions and claims that evade secular evaluation because they are typically unfalisiable, infinitely mutable in the face of objections, rooted in personal experiences that defy independent analysis, or rooted in the murk of human history. (*p. 8*)

> I think bioethics does well to function as a polite bystander in regard to believers but as not quote so polite a bystander with regard to religion itself. (*p. 9*)

> It is also fair for bioethics to examine the internal consistency of claims made from religions viewpoints, but it is really asking too much to disengage bioethics from a sketpical evaluation of the effets and comparative meaning of religions, an evluation that is compromised if it--in advance--commits itself to ensuring the integrity of religion. (*p. 9*)

> If bioethics really is going to pay attention to religion in all of its dimensions, that attention must extend beyond friendly rapprochement and engage in genuinely rigorous evaluations of their assumptions, creeds, and practices. (*p. 9*)

> An irreligious bioethics benefits everyone, theists, agnostics, and atheists alike, as it enables the field to think more critically and independently than is otherwise possible and to work twoard justice in bioethics without the expectation of a safety net of a life beyond this one...
